    LITERATURE
</h1>
<p> 
    It is amazing how easy it is for one can easily build a whole new world using books.
    Yet, it is sad that some haven't discovered the magic of getting lost within the pages.
    It is said that a reader has lived a thousand lives. With that being said, I have recently found the Classics very interesting, after all, a good book is one that leaves you staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m., one that tears your soul out.
    Here are some of my favorite ones so far.

<ol>
    <li> The Secret History</li>
    <li> The Great Gatsby </li>
    <li> Crime and Punishment</li>
    <li> Dead Poets  Society</li>
</ol>
